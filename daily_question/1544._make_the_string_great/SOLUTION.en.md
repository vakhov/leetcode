Let's go through the algorithm step by step with an illustration of the stack filling:

```python
def makeGood(s):
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if stack and abs(ord(char) - ord(stack[-1])) == 32:
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    return ''.join(stack)


s = "leEeetcode"
result = makeGood(s)
print(result)  # Output: "leetcode"
```

Algorithm steps:

Initialize an empty stack stack.
Begin iteration through each character char in the string s.
For each character:
Check if the stack is not empty and if the current character and the top character in the stack form a pair that can be
removed. We do this by computing the difference in ASCII codes and checking if it's equal to 32 (which corresponds to
the difference between uppercase and lowercase in ASCII). If so, remove the top character from the stack using pop().
If the pair of characters cannot be removed, add the current character to the stack using append().
After iterating through all characters, return the string formed by joining the characters in the stack into one string
using join().
Example of the algorithm's execution with an illustration of stack filling:

```
s = "leEeetcode"

Iteration 1:
char = 'l'
stack = ['l']

Iteration 2:
char = 'e'
stack = ['l', 'e']

Iteration 3:
char = 'E'
stack = ['l']  # 'e' and 'E' form a pair that can be removed

Iteration 4:
char = 'e'
stack = ['l', 'e']

Iteration 5:
char = 'e'
stack = ['l', 'e', 'e']

Iteration 6:
char = 't'
stack = ['l', 'e', 'e', 't']

Iteration 7:
char = 'c'
stack = ['l', 'e', 'e', 't', 'c']

Iteration 8:
char = 'o'
stack = ['l', 'e', 'e', 't', 'c', 'o']

Iteration 9:
char = 'd'
stack = ['l', 'e', 'e', 't', 'c', 'o', 'd']

Result: stack = "leetcode"
```

In the illustration above, we see how characters are added to the stack and how pairs of characters (e.g., 'e' and 'E')
are removed to make the string "good". In the end, we get the string "leetcode", which is the result of the algorithm's
execution.
